This is a repository containing trading algorithms I am creating in the cryptocurrency space.

I am running a strategy on ETH/USD on Kraken using the ADX indicator on the 4h timeframe. This strategy returned 158% from 2024-01-01 to 2024-09-30. I am now testing it live with very small size.

I am coding a mean reversion strategy on a number of coins on Kraken that do not tend to trend. I am in the process of determining the best parameters and will begin to backtest it soon.

Along with the mean reversion strategy, I am coding a trend following strategy that will take advantage of coins in the current crypto bull run.


Plan to continue / do next:
Market making trading algorithm to trade the bid/ask spread for profit. TBD which coins I will trade.

Use python to determine Bitcoin market regimes over the past 5 years by training an HMM model

Use python to connect to trader's wallets that have outperformed the market. I do this by connecting to the platform BirdEye using an API.

Strategies:
Average directional index strategy - use the average directional index to determine the trend of the market.

Market making strategy

Mean reversion strategy - take advantage of sideways moving markets through the belief that prices will always revert back to the mean

Solana copy bot - Copy the trades of whale investors who are outperforming the market. They know more than me, so I want trade how they trade.

Trend Following Strategy - strategy to take advantage of the consistently increasing prices during a crypto bull run.
