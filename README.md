This is a repository containing trading algorithms I am creating in the cryptocurrency space. 

I am using python to determine Bitcoin market regimes over the past 5 years by training an HMM model

I am using python to connect to trader's wallets that have outperformed the market. I do this by connecting to the platform BirdEye using an API.

I am also creating a trading algorithm to trade the current crypto bull run progammatically. I will be creating various strategies that I believe will generate me positive returns. Here I will be brainstorming strategies that I believe will give me the returns I am looking for.

Strategies:
Average directional index strategy - use the average directional index to determine the trend of the market.

Market making strategy

Mean reversion strategy - take advantage of sideways moving markets through the belief that prices will always revert back to the mean

Solana copy bot - Copy the trades of whale investors who are outperforming the market. They know more than me, so I want trade how they trade.

Trend Following Strategy - strategy to take advantage of the consistently increasing prices during a crypto bull run.
